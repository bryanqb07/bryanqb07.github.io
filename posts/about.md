title: "About Me"

The main theme of my life is a love for adventure and a taste for new things. As a kid growing up in the American suburbs, I was overcome with boredom and vowed that I would never get comfortable in life, never stop moving.

I started my career in NYC finance, soon got bored and moved to East Asia, where after a few years I became a translator for Chinese and Japanese.  After making little money in these endeavors and taking advantage of my lifelong hobby of computers and programming, I became a software engineer.  

These days, I'm obsessed with hacking / security engineering, and see that as the focus of my career from here on out, particularly exploit development.

In addition to my career, my interests involve homeschooling my two children as well as reading ancient history in its original source language, particularly Greek and Chinese.
